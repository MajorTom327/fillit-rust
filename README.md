# Just a fillit in Rust

I built this for fun. It's not perfect, but it works.
I just wanted to see how it would look like in Rust. I'm not a Rust expert, so I'm sure there are better ways to do this. And on the road, I learned a lot about Rust. (That was the objective sooo... mission accomplished!)
